# Ideas Something About My Research plan


Main theme is about:
 Research on Optimization of Software Testing and Reuse Strategies Based on Machine Learning

1. Machine Learning

    1.using LLMS? / Deep Learnming? / Traditional Machine Learning?

2. What kind of Algorithms to use?

3. Software Testing(Automated? Self developed)

Using Java、Android(?)、Python

3. Is it a must to use Fine-tuning and Evaluation



something might be used in research plan:

TensorFlow、Pytorch、Lora、Bert、Qlora、peft


First paper read will soon be uploaded:Machine Learning for Software Engineering A Tertiary Study

Second paper read will soon be uploaded:Software Reuse Research: Status and Future
